  {
    question: "How do I calculate Profit & Loss? - An Example",
    answer: `Profit is made by buying low and selling high. If you are bearish, short selling is also possible in the Currency market. The formula is as follows (excluding commission and daily swap adjustments):
      <br/><br/>
      Profit (Loss) = (Selling Price - Buying Price) x Contract Size.
      <br/><br/>
      **Example 1:**<br/>
      Bought 3 contracts of USD/JPY at 116.00 (I.e., bought USD 300,000 against JPY at the price of JPY 116.00 per USD).<br/>
      Sold 3 contracts of USD/JPY at 117.00 (I.e., sold USD 300,000 against JPY at the price of JPY 117.00 per USD).<br/>
      Profit (Loss) = (117.00 - 116.00) x 300,000 = JPY 300,000.<br/>
      Therefore, a profit of JPY 300,000 is made.
      <br/><br/>
      **Example 2:**<br/>
      Sold 5 contracts of GBP/USD at 2.0300 (I.e., sold GBP 500,000 against USD at the price of USD 2.0300 per GBP).<br/>
      Bought 5 contracts of GBP/USD at 2.0250 (I.e., bought GBP 500,000 against USD at the price of USD 2.0250 per GBP).<br/>
      Profit (Loss) = (2.0300 - 2.0250) x 500,000 = USD 2,500.`,
  },
  {
    question: "What is swap?",
    answer:
      "In Forex trading, swap refers to the interest differential between two currencies.",
  },
  {
    question: "How are swap point adjustments carried out?",
    answer: `Different currencies carry different interest yields. When holding a position, you buy (long) one currency and sell (short) another currency simultaneously. If you carry your position overnight, you will receive interest on the currency you bought (long) and pay interest on the currency you sold (short). The daily swap point adjustment reflects the interest differential of the two currencies you hold.
      <br/><br/>
      **Example:**<br/>
      You bought (long) NZD 100,000 and sold (short) JPY 100,000 at an exchange rate of 89.00. Assuming the NZD interest rate is 8% and the JPY interest rate is 0.5%, you would receive 8% for your NZD and pay 0.5% for your JPY. This results in a net interest (swap point) gain if you carry your position into the next day.
      <br/><br/>
      The net interest swap point gain is calculated as:
      <br/>
      Spot rate x (NZD interest rate receivable - JPY interest rate payable) / 360<br/>
      Contracted exchange rate = 89.00<br/>
      NZD interest rate receivable = 8%<br/>
      JPY interest rate payable = 0.5%<br/>
      <br/>
      The net interest swap point gain is: 89.00 x (8% - 0.5%) / 360 = 0.018542.<br/>
      Net interest receivable (payable) is calculated by: Swap point x Contract size.<br/>
      Thus, you would receive: 0.018542 x 100,000 = JPY 1,854.2 for carrying the long NZD/JPY position into the next day. This is also known as positive carry.`,

      "<strong>Limit Orders:</strong> Limit orders are price-specific orders that are placed away from the current market price. They give you more control over the execution price. The price of a limit-buy order is lower than the current market price and may be filled at the limit price or higher.<br/><br/>" +
      "<strong>Stop Orders:</strong> Stop orders are orders that become market orders when the market reaches a designated price. The price of a buy stop order is lower than the current market price and may be filled at the specified stop price or higher. The price of a sell stop order is higher than the current market price and may be filled at the specified stop price or lower.<br/><br/>" +
      "<strong>One Cancel the Other (OCO) Order:</strong> An OCO order is an order that allows you to place a Limit Order and a Stop Order at the same time. When one order is executed, the other order is automatically cancelled. For example, if the limit order is filled, the stop order is automatically cancelled, and vice-versa.",
