                FastOne Markets Limited ensure a clear
                segregation between money belonging to retail clients and money
                that belongs to the firm. Retail client money is transferred to
                a segregated client money bank account. In the unlikely event of
                FastOne Markets Limited insolvency, segregated
                client funds cannot be used for reimbursement to FastOne Global
                Financial Markets Limited's creditors.
